00:00.000 --> 00:05.280
I don't have anything against consoles, they're a great value and I own a PS5 and Xbox Series X

00:05.280 --> 00:10.480
myself. But what if you want an overpowered PC and access to your entire Steam library from the

00:10.480 --> 00:15.600
couch with a system that fits and looks like it belongs in the living room. So that's what we're

00:15.600 --> 00:20.000
going to build today. Let's talk about the parts, put this thing together, then we can check out

00:20.000 --> 00:23.840
the thermal and gaming performance you can expect in such a small compact system.

00:23.840 --> 00:34.400
For the CPU, I'm going to be using the 7800X 3D. Now there's a few reasons I chose this one. First,

00:34.400 --> 00:39.200
it's already considered the best gaming CPU you can buy and that's in large part due to the cores

00:39.200 --> 00:43.760
being accelerated with 3D vCache, which gives them more performance in single-thread applications

00:43.760 --> 00:48.480
like gaming. The second reason is that it's very efficient, making it much easier to cool,

00:48.480 --> 00:53.200
which is going to be important for this smaller form factor where we can only fit a low-profile

00:53.280 --> 00:59.760
CPU cooler. The 7800X 3D is currently priced at $450 and has 8 cores, 16 threads, and a

00:59.760 --> 01:04.880
boost clock up to 5 GHz. This CPU also requires a new AM5 motherboard. I'm going to be using the

01:04.880 --> 01:10.800
ASUS ROG Strix B650EI. This has plenty of USB ports, including a couple of Type-C ports,

01:10.800 --> 01:15.440
and a load of other features like a BIOS flashback button. We've also got Wi-Fi 6E,

01:15.440 --> 01:20.960
a Type-C header, which we will need for the case that we're using, and two M.2 slots along with

01:20.960 --> 01:31.040
some giant VRM heatsinks. This motherboard does support the next generation PCIe 5.0 M.2 drives.

01:31.040 --> 01:36.800
Those aren't widely available right now, so I'll be using a Gen4 Samsung 980 Pro. Gen5 doesn't seem

01:36.800 --> 01:42.400
to offer any real benefits over a Gen4 drive for gaming as of right now, so this will work out great

01:42.400 --> 01:46.960
in this build. I have a 2TB stick here, which is plenty of storage for me, but it'll be easy to

01:47.040 --> 01:51.040
expand with that second slot if it's ever needed. Okay, so now we can install the RAM,

01:51.040 --> 01:55.680
and for this build, we're going to need DDR5 memory. So I'm going with 32 gigs of Corsair's

01:55.680 --> 02:01.600
Vengeance DDR5 5600 memory. We need to use lower clearance sticks here in order to fit our low

02:01.600 --> 02:07.120
profile CPU cooler. This isn't necessarily the fastest DDR5 memory either. AMD has commented

02:07.120 --> 02:13.520
that DDR5 6000 is the optimal speed for the 7000 series CPUs. Still, this should work out just fine

02:13.520 --> 02:17.600
for our build. Now we need to make sure that the notch is correctly aligned and then apply

02:17.600 --> 02:25.760
even pressure until you hear it click into place. Now we can install the CPU cooler, and I'm going

02:25.760 --> 02:32.480
with the Noctua NH-L12S. These coolers are pretty popular for ITX builds, as they have a low profile

02:32.480 --> 02:37.040
and they do an excellent job keeping things cool despite its size. The total clearance on this

02:37.040 --> 02:42.320
cooler is 70mm when you have the 120mm fan installed underneath the fin stack, which is

02:42.320 --> 02:46.800
the exact max height we will be able to fit in the case. To install, we'll need to remove the

02:46.800 --> 02:50.640
pre-installed mounts from the motherboard by unscrewing these four screws and then taking

02:50.640 --> 02:55.600
them off. The cooler uses the existing backplate, so we can leave that in place and grab the two

02:55.600 --> 03:00.560
brackets that work for our chosen orientation. Now we can screw the new brackets into place and

03:00.560 --> 03:05.600
apply some thermal paste. A pea-sized mount in the center will work perfect. Next, lower the

03:05.600 --> 03:10.480
CPU cooler onto the brackets and begin screwing the cooler into place. Noctua actually includes

03:10.480 --> 03:14.880
a long screwdriver in the box to reach through these fins, which is actually really convenient

03:14.880 --> 03:19.440
here. We'll want to switch sides every two to three rotations to ensure even pressure across

03:19.440 --> 03:24.080
the CPU until it's fully into place. Now there's no need to use excessive force here, you can easily

03:24.080 --> 03:28.800
feel when it's completely tightened. Then we can plug in the CPU fan, and that's the motherboard

03:28.800 --> 03:33.440
prepped, and it's looking really good in my opinion. Super compact, and the CPU cooler is

03:33.440 --> 03:38.320
fitting perfectly. It's just barely clearing the VRM heatsinks, and it clears the RAM. Really good

03:38.320 --> 03:43.360
use of this limited space. Okay, so the case we're going to be using is the Fractal Design Ridge.

03:43.360 --> 03:48.400
Now I've wanted to build in this case for a while now, but they've been a bit hard to find. Although

03:48.400 --> 03:52.480
now they seem to be a little bit more readily available. There was an issue with the included

03:52.480 --> 03:58.640
GPU riser. It was originally marketed as a Gen 4, however there seems to be some compatibility

03:58.640 --> 04:03.120
issues, so now they're only considered Gen 3 compatible. I'm not sure if they plan to fix this,

04:03.120 --> 04:08.240
or sell an updated adapter. Still, it shouldn't affect our performance in any significant way.

04:08.240 --> 04:12.320
Of course, we need to remove the side panels, and to make the case easier to work in,

04:12.320 --> 04:17.520
I'm going to unscrew and remove the top and bottom panels. Then remove the middle GPU bracket here,

04:17.520 --> 04:22.160
which also contains part of the GPU riser. So now we can take the motherboard, align it with the

04:22.160 --> 04:27.200
four standoffs, then use the screws included with the case to secure it. Now before we install the

04:27.200 --> 04:32.080
power supply, I'm going to plug in these case cables while I still have some room. So that's

04:32.080 --> 04:37.840
the HD audio connector on the top right here, then the USB 3.0, USB type C, and the front panel

04:37.840 --> 04:43.440
connectors on the left. Fractal gave way too much slack to the stiff USB 3.0 cable, so we're going

04:43.440 --> 04:47.840
to have to figure out how we're going to manage that. Now it's time for the power supply, and I'm

04:47.840 --> 04:53.680
going to be using the Cooler Master V850 80 plus gold SFX power supply. Now you could get away with

04:53.680 --> 04:58.160
a lower wattage power supply here, depending on the GPU of course, but this is just what I had on

04:58.160 --> 05:03.280
hand, and this would leave a lot of headroom for a more powerful GPU in the future. So now we will

05:03.280 --> 05:07.760
need to remove this power supply bracket from the case by unscrewing on the front and back side of

05:07.760 --> 05:12.080
the case, and from there we can slide the bracket onto the power supply and secure it with the

05:12.080 --> 05:16.880
included four screws. Now we can slide it with the attached bracket back into place and re-secure it.

05:16.880 --> 05:22.000
Next we can plug in the 24-pin motherboard cable, and it's located on the left side, which is pretty

05:22.000 --> 05:26.080
difficult to access now that we have the power supply in. If you are building this, it might be

05:26.080 --> 05:30.400
easier to also plug this cable in before securing the power supply. Luckily I can still manage to

05:30.400 --> 05:34.400
get it plugged in without removing anything. Now we can plug in the 8-pin CPU connector

05:34.400 --> 05:38.400
at the bottom right, and then feed that cable across the bottom and up the left side of the

05:38.400 --> 05:43.040
motherboard to plug into the power supply. I'm also going to plug in an 8-pin PCIe power cable

05:43.040 --> 05:48.160
that we will use later for the GPU and run that up to the top of the case. Finally it's time to

05:48.160 --> 05:52.000
plug in the case fans by running them around the back side of the case and through one of the

05:52.000 --> 05:56.560
pass-throughs to the motherboard. Now let's install the GPU bracket. So we can open up the

05:56.560 --> 06:02.400
PCIe slot on the motherboard, then align the pins on the bracket to the PCIe slot, and gently push

06:02.400 --> 06:06.400
until it clicks into place. Then just secure the bracket back to the case. And everything's looking

06:06.400 --> 06:11.040
great, so it's time to do some cable management to clean things up before we move to the GPU.

06:11.040 --> 06:17.040
For the GPU, I wanted to test out the newly released RTX 4070 Founders Edition. So first off,

06:17.040 --> 06:22.480
this card looks great. It follows the same design patterns as the larger 4080 and 4090s.

06:22.480 --> 06:27.920
It hasn't exactly had the warmest reception from initial reviews, which seems mostly due to its

06:27.920 --> 06:33.600
price to performance. Now usually the 70 series GPUs offers the performance of the top tier card

06:33.600 --> 06:38.640
of the previous generation, but for like half the price. Instead, we're getting roughly 3080

06:38.640 --> 06:43.600
performance for $600. And Nvidia seems to be leaning more toward the technology advancements

06:43.600 --> 06:49.520
in things like DLSS as the main value add, more than just raw performance. Which on one hand is

06:49.520 --> 06:54.480
fair, but the problem is not a lot of games use DLSS 3 and frame generation at the moment.

06:54.480 --> 06:59.120
And for competitive players, that's not really a technology they would utilize due to the increase

06:59.120 --> 07:04.320
in latency. In my opinion, that doesn't make this a bad card. Even at the $600 price point,

07:04.320 --> 07:08.560
it still might even be the best option for a lot of people. And with the 4070, you're getting the

07:08.560 --> 07:13.120
benefits of better ray tracing performance and DLSS in the supported games. Either way,

07:13.120 --> 07:17.440
I wanted to check this card out for myself and I knew it would fit nicely in this build.

07:17.440 --> 07:21.920
So to get the GPU into the case, we need to remove this top bracket. There are four screws on the

07:21.920 --> 07:26.160
front side and another eight screws on the backside to give this off. Four of those are the top fan

07:26.160 --> 07:30.480
screws, which is kind of crazy in my opinion. I think Fractal needs to look into making more

07:30.480 --> 07:35.760
of this case tool-less. Once removed, we can add the GPU riser to the 4070, align it to the slot

07:35.760 --> 07:41.920
on the GPU bracket, and gently push until it locks into place. Then plug the included power

07:41.920 --> 07:46.800
adapter into the two eight pins we ran earlier and connect the other end to the GPU. There's

07:46.800 --> 07:51.840
plenty of space for a larger GPU here. You could fit a GPU up to 335 millimeters, which should

07:51.840 --> 07:57.920
comfortably fit a 4070 Ti or even a Founder's 4080. If you go for a larger GPU, you will want

07:57.920 --> 08:02.320
to be mindful of the clearance at the top for the adapter. You would likely need to get a right angle

08:02.320 --> 08:07.680
adapter or a cable that is more flexible than the adapter that's included with the 4000 series cards.

08:10.320 --> 08:17.680
Okay, now we can re-secure the panels, and that's the build complete.

08:32.320 --> 08:38.560
Before we move on, if you want to see more builds like this in the future, it would mean a lot to me

08:38.560 --> 08:42.720
if you subscribed. It really helps the channel, and it's the biggest indicator to me that I should

08:42.720 --> 08:48.000
continue making videos like this. So, thank you. All right, I think this build is looking really

08:48.000 --> 08:52.640
nice, and a few things I did to make it more console-like is to set auto login and then launch

08:52.640 --> 08:57.120
Steam Big Picture mode. But also, I wanted to be able to wake the system with a controller. Now,

08:57.120 --> 09:01.760
I found that this only works with the older Xbox dongle. I haven't found a way for it to work with

09:01.760 --> 09:06.480
Bluetooth or the newer Xbox and PlayStation dongles. If you know of a way, please let me know.

09:06.480 --> 09:11.200
Also, there's still situations when you'll need to update drivers or do other things on the PC.

09:11.200 --> 09:15.840
I used this mini keyboard I found on Amazon for $30. It's made using a living room PC,

09:15.840 --> 09:19.760
significantly less cumbersome. It has a full keyboard, a trackpad in the middle,

09:19.760 --> 09:23.520
and shoulder buttons for left and right mouse clicks. What's nice about this one is that it

09:23.520 --> 09:28.240
has Bluetooth and USB options. You can wake the PC by toggling the switch on the mini keyboard.

09:29.200 --> 09:34.480
Okay, so now let's check out performance. Starting with Cyberpunk in 1440p and just

09:34.480 --> 09:39.200
rasterization, so that's without DLSS, and we're getting 60 to 70 frames per second.

09:39.200 --> 09:43.920
Realistically, I think in a game like this, you'll want to turn on DLSS and frame generation.

09:43.920 --> 09:49.040
And if you do, then you get a nice bump to around 100 to 130 frames per second. Now,

09:49.040 --> 09:53.360
if you're hooking this up to a 4K display with the same settings, then you're looking at around 70

09:53.360 --> 09:58.400
to 80 frames per second. Now, frame generation will add a bit of latency, but I think that's

09:58.400 --> 10:03.200
fine for these more cinematic titles, especially considering it can nearly double the frame rate

10:03.200 --> 10:08.640
in some games. Jumping into Hogwarts Legacy here in 1440p and rasterization performance is pretty

10:08.640 --> 10:13.760
decent at 60 to 70 frames per second on ultra settings. Now, again, you can utilize DLSS and

10:13.760 --> 10:18.720
frame generation to get a nice increase in frame rate. And using those features in 4K, we're looking

10:18.720 --> 10:24.640
at 70 to 80 frames per second. And look at those temps. Very reasonable in such a small form factor.

10:24.640 --> 10:29.760
Apex Legends again in 1440p high settings, and we're getting really decent performance here at

10:29.760 --> 10:35.120
170 to 200 frames per second. And if you want to bump the resolution up to 4K, we're getting over

10:35.120 --> 10:40.400
100 to 130 frames per second in those high settings, so you could drop those if you wanted more

10:40.400 --> 10:50.240
performance. For GPU thermals, running Heaven Benchmark, and it's averaging 64 degrees Celsius

10:50.240 --> 10:54.400
with very little fan noise. And in a worst-case scenario, running a multi-core stress test in

10:54.400 --> 11:00.160
Cinebench R23, and CPU temps are reaching around 80 degrees Celsius. Considering the size of this

11:00.160 --> 11:05.680
low-profile cooler, I'm still really impressed on how well it's cooling the 7800X 3D. Now,

11:05.680 --> 11:09.920
this system is built for gaming, and those thermals look great in my opinion. I'm seeing

11:09.920 --> 11:15.440
the CPU and GPU averaging around high 50s to mid 60s depending on the game. So I'm quite happy with

11:15.440 --> 11:20.720
this build overall. I wish the 4070 had a more reasonable price to performance, but that's kind

11:20.720 --> 11:25.760
of been the story with most of this generation of GPUs. And I'm continuously impressed on how

11:25.760 --> 11:32.640
efficient and easy to cool the 7800X 3D is. That CPU is just a monster. And I think the case looks

11:32.640 --> 11:37.840
really clean as well. I didn't really run into any issues building in it, but I do wish Fractal

11:37.840 --> 11:42.400
would make some of it tool-less. This is also a case you'll want to properly plan out ahead of

11:42.400 --> 11:48.400
time, as it's pretty limited in what it can fit. But I'm overall pretty happy with all the parts

11:48.400 --> 11:52.800
that I chose here. Everything ended up fitting together really nicely, and I didn't really have

11:52.800 --> 11:57.040
any issues putting it all together. Anyway, let me know what you think of the build. What do you like?

11:57.040 --> 12:01.120
What would you change? And if you want to build something similar to this, I'll have links in

12:01.120 --> 12:05.760
the video description. So thanks again for watching. I will see you in the next one.
